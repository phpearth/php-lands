A dollar sign in front of variables in PHP is inspired by Perl which greatly influenced PHP during its early years. Many other programming languages also use a dollar sign in their syntax. This symbol is called “sigil” and simplifies interpolation. Names not prefixed by $ are considered constants, functions, class names, etc. Sigil usage simplifies the variable interpolation into strings.",
